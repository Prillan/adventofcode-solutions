** Notes

- For 2020's event I (finally) started adding a library for common
  functions, it can be found [[file:adventofcode][here]].
- The correct version of GHC can be pulled in by simply running
  ~nix-shell~. Of course, that requires that you have
  [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] installed.
- I'm not sure what version of GHC (+ libraries) I used for earlier
  years. I'll try to clean that up.
- This README is also a WIP...
